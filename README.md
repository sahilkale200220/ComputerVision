So Basically the name of the project is Volume control by using Hand Gestures
In this Project basically the idea is to project the hand using computer vision and to see if the volumne can be increased or decreased by using the hand gestures of not.
basically if the thumb and index fingers are touched then volumne is set to be Zero and as the distance between thumb and index finger increases then the volume also increases
Also I have added a bar on the camera screen to see the change in volumne . Also there are some add-on's like FPS rate , the highlights in the finger tips . Not in detail but in breif I can tell that  I have used libraries like mediapipe , pycaw , cv2 and many other libraries to build this project.
Hope u will find along all the details in the code I have mentioned which will be easy to understand to anyone. Good Luck !
